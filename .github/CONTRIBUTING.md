# Opening a pull request

## General

Pull requests are welcome! Here are the rules of engagement:

- The philosophy here is about communication, taking responsibility for your changes, and fast, incremental delivery.
- Speak to the team before you decide to do anything major. We can probably help design the change to maximise the chances of it being accepted.
- Pull requests made to master assume the change is ready to be released.
- Many small requests will be reviewed/merged quicker than a giant lists of changes.
- If you have a proposal, or want feedback on a branch under development, prefix `[WIP]` to the pull request title.

### Please be aware that we use the Apache License 2.0, and so:

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

Your contributions should be wholly your own.
