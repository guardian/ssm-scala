# Opening a pull request

## General

Pull requests are welcome! Here are the rules of engagement:

- The philosophy here is about communication, taking responsibility for your changes, and fast, incremental delivery.
- Speak to the team before you decide to do anything major. We can probably help design the change to maximise the chances of it being accepted.
- Pull requests made to main assume the change is ready to be released.
- Many small requests will be reviewed/merged quicker than a giant lists of changes.
- If you have a proposal, or want feedback on a branch under development, prefix `[WIP]` to the pull request title.
